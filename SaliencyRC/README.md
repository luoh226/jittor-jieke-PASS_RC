# SaliencyRC
This the python implementation of  the  saliency cut method proposed in the paper "Global Contrast based Salient Region Detection".By the way I just implement the Histogram contrast based method.

# Requirements
- python 3.6
- numpy
- opencv

# Test Case
run ` python test.py ` to get the salency map
